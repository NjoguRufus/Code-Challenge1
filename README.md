# student-Grade-Generator
This code is used to determine a student's grade based on their marks. Here's an explanation of the code:

1.A prompt is displayed to the user asking for the student's marks (between 0 and 100).

T2.he input is stored in the marks variable after converting it to a floating point number.

3.The isNaN function is used to check if the marks variable is a number.

4.If it is not a number, then the code displays an error message and exits the program.

5.If the marks variable is a number, then the code checks if the value is between 0 and 100. 

6.If the value is not between 0 and 100, then the code displays an error message and exits the program.

7.If the marks variable is a number between 0 and 100, then the code determines the student's grade based on their marks using if-else statements.

>>The grade is stored in the grade variable, which is then displayed to the one using

# For instance
# If the user enters >79, then the grade will be "A".
# If the user enters below 7d and above 60, then the grade will be "B".
# If the user enters <59 and>50, then the grade will be "C".
# If the user enters >40 and above 40, then the grade will be "D".
# If the user enters anything other than a number between 0 and 100, then the code will display an error message.
